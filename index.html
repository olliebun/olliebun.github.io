      <h2 id="my-work">My Work</h2>

      <p>I'm a self-taught back-end Software Developer working at a Logistics firm. No tertiary education.</p>

      <p>I've had a &gt;10 year career jumping sectors between marketing, education, renewable energy and telcos.</p>

      <p>Excellence & empathy is the goal. Quality first. People over tools. Having said that, I love: golang, python, linux, postgres, git, AWS, testing in production</p>

      <p>I love <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a>. I hate "Agile Methodology".</p>

      <p>I used to be quite involved in open source & infosec. I went to Linux Conf AU and PyCon AU for a number of years.</p>

      <h2 id="gender-transition">"Gender", "Transition"</h2>

      <p>I am a detransitioner. From 2015 to 2021 I identified as a trans woman and was on HRT - first oral testosterone blockers and estrogen, then a series of subcutaneous implants coupled with oral progesterone.</p>

      <p>At that time in the state of NSW, I needed a note from a psychiatrist to commence HRT. I saw a specialist who wrote a letter indicating that his impression was one of gender dysphoria.</p>

      <p>I am infertile, and do not have anything in storage. I want to have children.</p>

      <p>I went off cold turkey as a free choice. I am a man.</p>

      <p>I have never had gender dysphoria. I believed that I was trans due to a variety of personal, social and political factors. The root of it all was my own trauma.</p>

      <p>I have serious concerns about the affirmative care model due to the rapid institutional acceptance of a fairly extreme view of sex and gender, and the ongoing replacement of science & medicine with ideology when it comes to trans care and policy.</p>

      <p>In principle, I support access to trans healthcare (HRT, surgery) for adults with gender dysphoria. A friend of mine - a transexual woman with a DSD - says she's never been happier since her surgery. I believe her.</p>

      <p>I try to tell my story with respect and humility.</p>

      <p>I am the prisoner of chips. They are my favourite food. I have held this title since 2012 and not come across a serious contentor.</p>
